# event-countdown-timer

I created this project - a countdown timer in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a feature that displays the time remaining until a specific event. The timer dynamically updates every second, and you can customize the CSS to match your webpage's style. It's a simple yet elegant way to build excitement and anticipation for your upcoming event.
